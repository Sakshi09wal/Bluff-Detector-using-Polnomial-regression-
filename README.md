Business scenario: Human Resources team is about to hire a new employee in the company. During the salary negotiation process,a potential employee candidate tells he has 20+ years of experience (it corresponds to the level 6.5 in the given dataset) and earned 160,000 annual salary in his previous company. Therefore, he is asking now for at least more than 160,000. One of the HRs decides to check this info. To do this he has the only data set about ten different positions and salaries in 
the candidateâ€™s previous company. You, as a data scientist helping HR, have to build a regression model and to predict if this
new candidate employee is bluffing about his salary or not. You have to build this bluffing detector by using a polynomial
regression for the Pos_Sal.csv file.
